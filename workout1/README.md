### Workout 1: GSW Shot Charts

#### Decription

The purpose of Workout 1 is to visualize shot data for the Golden State Warriors during the 2015-2016 season. I specifically looked at shot data for Stephen Curry, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thomspon, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green using two methods of analysis: facetted shot chart visuals and tables to interpret their effective shooting percentage.
